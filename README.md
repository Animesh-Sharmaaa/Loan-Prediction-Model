**Loan Prediction Model**


📌 Overview


This project predicts the likelihood of a loan application being approved based on applicant details such as income, credit history, and other demographic information.
The model uses machine learning techniques to process input features and output a binary decision: Loan Approved or Loan Not Approved.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns in loan approvals

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Prediction on new/unseen data

Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – Data handling

matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization

scikit-learn – Model building and evaluation

joblib – Model saving/loading

📊 Model Workflow
Load dataset

Clean and preprocess data

Perform EDA

Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Evaluate and select the best model

Save and deploy the model

📈 Results
Best model achieved XX% accuracy on the test dataset.

Key features influencing loan approval:
